    <h2>Raul Souza</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, I am Raul Souza and I am 28 years old, from Brasilia, Brazil. I currently live in Pleasant Grove, Utah and I am pursuing a BS in Software Development.</p> 
    <p>I like to go on hikes, workout at the gym and I love to practice meditation.</p> 
    <p>The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is the supportive learning environment and the flexibility it offers to students. I'm taking this course to enhance my career prospects and gain the ability to create engaging web experiences.</p>
    <p>I was born in the church and I served a full time mission in Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. One of my favorite quotes from a church leader is: "Faith and doubt cannot exist in the same mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other" - President Thomas S. Monson. A favorite scripture of mine is Philippians 4:13: "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.".</p>
    <p>I am excited to be here!</p>
